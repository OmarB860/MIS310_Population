This program is an assignment where I worked with dictionaries, functions, and input validation to look up population data based on state codes. I created a dictionary that stores population values for several states, and then wrote a function called retrieve_pop that checks whether a user’s input matches a valid key and returns the correct population if it does. In the main function, I built a loop that keeps asking the user for a state code until they either enter a valid one or choose to stop trying. I also made sure the input is cleaned by removing extra spaces and converting everything to uppercase so it matches the dictionary keys correctly. If the user enters an invalid code, the program prints an error message and shows all valid options before asking whether they want to try again. Overall, this program shows that I understand how to use dictionaries, handle user input, validate entries, and structure a loop that continues based on user choice.
